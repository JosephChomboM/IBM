    "In this test, we take the null hypothesis proportion (0.52) to be a fixed, known value, not an estimate obtained from data (that therefore would be uncertain and inexact). The Statsmodels [proportions_ztest](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest.html) function returns a test statistic and corresponding p-value.  This test statistic is a Z-score, meaning that the further the test statistic falls from zero, the more evidence against the null hypothesis.  In this example, the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, and in most settings this would be considered to provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis."
