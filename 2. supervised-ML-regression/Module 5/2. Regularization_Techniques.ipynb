Overfitting leads to poor ability of the model to make predictions on the new, unseen data. As we saw in the previous Regression Lessons, with a creation of extra features, such as through polynomial regression, a model can become easily overfit. To reduce the overfitting, we can regularize the model, or in other words, we can decrease its degrees of freedom. A simple way to regularize polynomial model is to reduce the number of polynomial degrees. For a linear regression model, regularization is typically achieved by constraining the weights of the model. Regularizer imposes a penalty on the size of the coefficients of the model.\n","\n","In this lab, we will cover three types of regularizers:\n","\n","*   Ridge regression\n","*   Lasso regression\n","*   Elastic Net\n","\n","Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Lasso will eliminate many features and reduce overfitting in your linear model. Ridge will reduce the impact of the features that are not important in predicting your target. Elastic Net combines feature elimination from Lasso and feature coefficient reduction from the Ridge model to improve your model’s predictions.\n","\n","The common features of all these regularizers include using cross-validation to select hyperparameters and applying data normalization to improve the performance.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you will be able to:\n","\n","*   Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net Regressions\n","*   Apply Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net Regressions\n","*   Perform  hyperparameters Grid Search on a model using validation data\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02af0994-366d-46d2-a5f9-8006a3773460","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["***\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d1cbafac-79fc-4dc8-9975-f390c2b3b724","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## **Setup**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ef62d2e-94be-4c45-a590-f2e3ae453ff1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:\n","\n","*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for managing the data.\n","*   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for mathematical operations.\n","*   [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for visualizing the data.\n","*   [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for visualizing the data.\n","*   [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.\n","*   [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/stats.html/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork34171862-2022-01-01) for statistical computations.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"09f2bf00-6f8a-4c90-b06d-1485027d1d5c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## **Import the required libraries**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d13e625-f49e-4356-b03b-22e575050a5b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["The following required modules are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment.
